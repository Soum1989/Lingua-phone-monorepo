# Lingua Phone Application Status

## Current Status

- **Backend Service**: ✅ Running
- **Frontend Service**: ❌ CrashLoopBackOff (29 restarts)

## What This Means

The frontend pod is continuously crashing and restarting, which is indicated by the `CrashLoopBackOff` status. This means Kubernetes starts the pod, it crashes, and then Kubernetes tries to restart it again in a continuous loop.

## What We've Done to Fix It

1. **Updated Frontend Deployment Configuration**
   - Modified [k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml) to properly use the ConfigMap for nginx configuration
   - Added volume mount for nginx configuration from ConfigMap
   - Ensured proper mounting of the [nginx-k8s.conf](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/nginx-k8s.conf) file

2. **Applied the Fix**
   - Applied the updated deployment configuration to your GKE cluster
   - Deleted the existing frontend pod to force Kubernetes to create a new one with the updated configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Wait a few minutes** for the new pod to initialize with our fix
2. **Check if the pod is now running**:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app
   ```

3. **If it's still crashing, check the logs**:
   ```
   kubectl logs -l app=lingua-frontend -n lingua-app
   ```

4. **Access your application** at: http://34.45.239.154

## Common Causes of Frontend Crashes

1. Nginx configuration issues
2. Missing files in the Docker image
3. Port binding problems
4. Configuration mismatch between services

## Need Further Assistance?

If the frontend continues to crash after a few minutes:

1. Run the diagnostic script: `diagnose-frontend-crash.bat`
2. Check the detailed logs in the generated text files
3. Review the nginx configuration in [docker/nginx-k8s.conf](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/nginx-k8s.conf)
4. Ensure the backend service name matches between frontend and backend configurations

The backend service name should be `lingua-backend-service` and this should match in both the frontend nginx configuration and the backend service definition.
