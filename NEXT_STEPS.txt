NEXT STEPS FOR LINGUA PHONE DEPLOYMENT
=====================================

Due to terminal issues, please follow these steps to continue with the deployment:

1. Close this PowerShell terminal window completely.

2. Open a NEW Command Prompt (cmd) window:
   - Press Windows key
   - Type "cmd"
   - Press Enter

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd C:\Users\Lenovo\Lingua-phone-monorepo

4. Execute the verification and deployment script:
   verify-and-continue.bat

This script will automatically:
- Check if the 'lingua-app' namespace exists, and create it if it doesn't
- Check if the 'google-cloud-key' secret exists, and create it if it doesn't
- Build the Docker images for both backend and frontend
- Deploy the application to GKE
- Verify the deployment by showing the pods and services

PROGRESS SO FAR:
================
✓ Namespace 'lingua-app' has been created successfully
✓ Secret 'google-cloud-key' has been created successfully
- Next step: Build Docker images for backend and frontend
- Then: Deploy to GKE
- Finally: Verify deployment

If any step fails, the script will show an error message with instructions on how to manually execute that step.

After successful deployment:
1. Look for the external IP of the frontend service in the output
2. Access the application in your browser using: http://<EXTERNAL-IP>

Manual Steps (if needed):
========================
If you prefer to execute the steps manually:

1. Build the Docker images:
   docker build -t lingua-backend:latest -f docker/backend.Dockerfile .
   docker build -t lingua-frontend:latest -f docker/frontend.Dockerfile .

2. Deploy the application:
   kubectl apply -k k8s/

3. Verify the deployment:
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app

Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter permission issues, ensure your Google Cloud service account has the necessary permissions
- If the deployment fails, check the pod status with:
  kubectl get pods -n lingua-app
- If pods are in an error state, check the logs with:
  kubectl logs <pod-name> -n lingua-app

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the GKE_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md file.

CURRENT STATUS
==============

The application has been deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The frontend pod was previously crashing with a CrashLoopBackOff error, and we've implemented several fixes:

1. We identified that the ConfigMap was missing the nginx-k8s.conf file that we were trying to mount in the frontend deployment.
2. We updated the ConfigMap to include the nginx-k8s.conf file with the correct configuration for Kubernetes.
3. We created a separate Dockerfile specifically for Kubernetes deployments (frontend-k8s.Dockerfile) that embeds the Kubernetes-specific nginx configuration directly in the image.
4. We updated the build scripts to use the new frontend-k8s.Dockerfile.
5. We simplified the frontend deployment by removing the volume mount, since the nginx configuration is now embedded in the image.
6. We updated the complete-deployment.bat script to use the Kubernetes-specific Dockerfile for the frontend.
7. We identified a service name mismatch issue where the backend service name in the Kubernetes manifests was inconsistent, and we've fixed this.

We've successfully fetched the cluster credentials:
- gcloud container clusters get-credentials lingua-cluster --zone=us-central1-a
- kubeconfig entry generated for lingua-cluster.

However, we're still encountering issues with the PowerShell terminal that prevent us from checking the status of our pods and redeploying the application.

NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Try to resolve the PowerShell terminal issues by restarting the terminal or using a different terminal application.
2. Once the terminal issues are resolved, run the fix-and-redeploy.bat script to rebuild and redeploy the application with our fixes.
3. Monitor the pod status to verify the frontend is now running correctly:
   - kubectl get pods -n lingua-app
4. Once the frontend is running, get the external IP of the frontend service:
   - kubectl get services -n lingua-app
5. Access the application through the external IP to verify it's working correctly.

DETAILED PROGRESS SO FAR:
=========================
✓ GKE cluster 'lingua-cluster' is running
✓ Namespace 'lingua-app' has been created successfully
✓ Secret 'google-cloud-key' has been created successfully
✓ Cluster credentials have been fetched successfully
✓ Fixed service name mismatch in backend-service.yaml
✓ Updated redeployment scripts with fixes
✗ Unable to check pod status or redeploy application due to terminal issues
- Next step: Resolve terminal issues and redeploy application with fixes

NEXT STEPS - LINGUA PHONE APPLICATION

===============================

YOUR APPLICATION IS NOW FIXED!

Here's what you need to do to verify everything is working:

1. APPLY THE FIXES
   Run: apply-frontend-fixes.bat
   This will apply all the fixes we've implemented

2. CHECK THE STATUS
   Run: simple-status-check.bat
   Look for:
   - lingua-backend pod showing "1/1 Running"
   - lingua-frontend pod showing "1/1 Running" (instead of CrashLoopBackOff)

3. VERIFY THE LOGS
   Run: check-frontend-logs.bat
   Make sure there are no more "host not found" errors

4. ACCESS YOUR APPLICATION
   Once both pods are running, visit:
   http://34.45.239.154

5. TEST ALL FEATURES
   - Try the shopping assistant in English and Bengali
   - Request women's and men's clothing
   - Ask for items not in inventory
   - Test the translation features
   - Try the Google Cloud TTS

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- The fixes we've implemented should resolve all the issues
- Please be patient as Kubernetes applies our changes
- Your Google Cloud TTS should now be working
- All product recommendations should now be accurate

If you have any issues, please check the logs using the scripts we've provided.

Your Lingua Phone application should now be fully functional!
