CRASHLOOPBACKOFF - EXPLAINED SIMPLY

================================

WHAT IT MEANS:
The frontend part of your application keeps crashing and restarting.

WHY IT HAPPENS:
Think of it like a computer that turns on, encounters an error, shuts down, and then tries to turn on again - only to encounter the same error and shut down again. This creates a loop.

COMMON CAUSES:
- Configuration files are incorrect
- The application can't find what it needs to run
- There's a mismatch between different parts of the system

WHAT WE'VE DONE TO FIX IT:
1. We found the configuration issue
2. We corrected the nginx configuration file
3. We updated how the frontend connects to the backend
4. We applied these fixes to your Google Kubernetes Engine deployment
5. We deleted the old problematic pod to force creation of a new one

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NOW:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for the changes to take effect
2. Run: COMPLETE_STATUS_CHECK.bat
3. Look for the frontend pod to show "1/1 Running" instead of "CrashLoopBackOff"
4. Access your application at: http://34.45.239.154

THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE:
Many applications experience this during deployment. Our fixes should resolve it.
