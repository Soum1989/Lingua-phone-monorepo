## Diagnostic Tools Created

### Application Status Check
- `application-status-check.bat` - Verifies if the application is accessible and checks pod/service status

### Frontend Issue Diagnosis
- `diagnose-frontend-issues.bat` - Provides detailed information about frontend pod crashes and errors

### Frontend Image Verification
- `check-frontend-image.bat` - Checks if the frontend image exists in Google Container Registry

### Complete Frontend Fix
- `complete-frontend-fix.bat` - Rebuilds and pushes the frontend image, then redeploys to the cluster

### Cluster Resource Check
- `cluster-resource-check.bat` - Provides a comprehensive view of all cluster resources

## Current Status

The application is functionally complete with all requested features implemented. However, there is an ongoing deployment issue with the frontend pods experiencing `CrashLoopBackOff` and `RunContainerError` status in the GKE cluster.

## Next Steps

1. Run `diagnose-frontend-issues.bat` to get detailed error information
2. Run `check-frontend-image.bat` to verify the frontend image exists in GCR
3. If needed, run `complete-frontend-fix.bat` to rebuild and redeploy the frontend
4. Run `cluster-resource-check.bat` for a comprehensive view of cluster resources
5. Finally, run `application-status-check.bat` to verify if the application is accessible

The external IP for the application is: http://34.45.239.154

Once the frontend pod issues are resolved, the application should be fully accessible at this address.
