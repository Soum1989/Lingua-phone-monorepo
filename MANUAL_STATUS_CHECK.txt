Lingua Phone - Manual Deployment Status Check
============================================

Please follow these steps manually in your terminal:

1. First, make sure you're authenticated with Google Cloud:
   gcloud auth list

2. Get cluster credentials:
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials lingua-cluster --zone=us-central1-a

3. Check the status of your pods:
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app

4. Check the status of your services:
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app

5. If the frontend pod is still in CrashLoopBackOff status, check its logs:
   kubectl logs <frontend-pod-name> -n lingua-app
   (Replace <frontend-pod-name> with the actual name of your frontend pod)

6. Redeployment options:
   
   Option A: Using Miniconda (since you have it installed)
   - First, check if Miniconda is properly set up:
     check-miniconda-setup.bat
   - If everything is set up correctly, run the deployment script:
     complete-deployment-miniconda.bat

   Option B: Without Python dependency
   - Run the deployment script that doesn't require Python:
     complete-deployment-no-python.bat

Expected Results:
- Both pods should show "1/1 Running" status
- The frontend service should have an external IP assigned
- No more "CrashLoopBackOff" errors

Troubleshooting:
If the frontend pod is still crashing:
1. Check that the nginx configuration in docker/nginx-k8s.conf contains:
   server lingua-backend-service:3002;
   
2. Verify that the frontend Dockerfile (docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile) copies the nginx configuration correctly

3. Make sure the Google Cloud TTS is properly configured with the service account
