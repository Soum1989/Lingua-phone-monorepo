Lingua Phone - Deployment Status Check Instructions
==================================================

Since we're having issues with the terminal, please follow these manual steps:

1. Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd C:\Users\Lenovo\Lingua-phone-monorepo

3. Check the status of your pods:
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app

4. Check the status of your services:
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app

Expected Results:
- Both pods should show "1/1 Running" status
- The frontend service should have an external IP assigned

If the frontend pod is still in CrashLoopBackOff status:
1. Get the exact name of the frontend pod:
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app | findstr lingua-frontend

2. Check the logs of the frontend pod:
   kubectl logs <frontend-pod-name> -n lingua-app
   (Replace <frontend-pod-name> with the actual name from step 1)

3. If you need to redeploy:
   complete-deployment-no-python.bat

After successful deployment:
1. Get the external IP of your application:
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app

2. Access your application through the external IP shown above.
