- ✅ Google Cloud Translation API integrated
- ✅ Proper authentication with service account keys

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment Preparation
- ✅ Application prepared for deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- ✅ All configuration issues resolved
- ✅ Docker images built and ready for deployment

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Frontend Container DNS Resolution
**Problem**: nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream lingua-backend-service:3002
**Solution**: Fixed nginx.conf to use correct service name "backend:3002" to match docker-compose service name

### Google Cloud TTS Not Enabled
**Problem**: "Google Cloud TTS not enabled, using fallback"
**Solution**: 
- Saved service account key with proper Cloud TTS User permissions
- Updated docker-compose.yml to mount keys directory
- Provided instructions for granting proper IAM permissions

### Shopping Assistant Recommendation Failures
**Problem**: Shopping assistant not providing any recommendations
**Solution**: Fixed recommendation system to properly call getProductRecommendations

### Translation Issues (Especially Bengali)
**Problem**: Translation not working properly
**Solution**: Implemented proper multilingual support with Google Cloud Translation API

### Gender-Specific Clothing Recommendations
**Problem**: Incorrect recommendations (men's clothing for women's queries)
**Solution**: Enhanced product matching with gender-aware logic

### GKE Deployment Issues
**Problem**: Frontend pod crashing with CrashLoopBackOff status
**Solution**: Multiple fixes including:
- Fixed service name mismatch in backend-service.yaml
- Updated nginx configuration in ConfigMap to use correct service name
- Created Kubernetes-specific frontend Dockerfile
- Simplified frontend deployment by removing problematic volume mounts
