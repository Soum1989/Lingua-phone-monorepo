# Final Docker Fix for Frontend Container Issue

## Problem Identified

The frontend container is failing to start with the error:
```
nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream "lingua-backend-service:3002" in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:10
```

## Root Cause

In the nginx configuration file (`docker/nginx.conf`), the upstream backend is configured to point to `lingua-backend-service:3002`, but in the docker-compose.yml file, the backend service is simply named `backend`. Docker Compose allows services to reference each other by their service names, so we need to align these names.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed nginx.conf

Changed line 10 in `docker/nginx.conf` from:
```nginx
server lingua-backend-service:3002;
```

To:
```nginx
server backend:3002;
```

This allows the nginx server in the frontend container to properly resolve and connect to the backend service.

## Complete Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure the nginx.conf file is updated**:
   ```
   # In docker/nginx.conf, line 10 should be:
   server backend:3002;
   ```

2. **Restart the Docker environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Verify both containers are running**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. **Check the logs if issues persist**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs frontend
   docker-compose logs backend
   ```

## Expected Results

After implementing this fix:
- Both frontend and backend containers should start successfully
- The application should be accessible at http://localhost:8080
- The shopping assistant should work correctly with multilingual support
- Product recommendations should work for all languages including Bengali
- Gender-specific clothing should be properly recommended

## Additional Notes

1. The docker-compose.yml file correctly defines the service names:
   - Frontend service: `frontend`
   - Backend service: `backend`

2. The `depends_on` directive in docker-compose.yml ensures the backend starts before the frontend

3. The nginx configuration now correctly references the backend service by its docker-compose service name

4. Port mappings are correctly configured:
   - Frontend: 8080:80 (host:container)
   - Backend: 3002:3002 (host:container)

## Troubleshooting

If containers still don't start after this fix:

1. **Check for syntax errors in nginx.conf**:
   ```bash
   # You can validate nginx configuration with:
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/docker/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro nginx nginx -t
   ```

2. **Verify docker-compose.yml syntax**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose config
   ```

3. **Check Docker Desktop is running** and has sufficient resources

4. **Clear Docker cache if needed**:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   ```

## Testing the Fix

Once both containers are running:

1. **Access the application** at http://localhost:8080
2. **Test the shopping assistant** with queries like:
   - "I'm looking for a women's t-shirt"
   - "Show me some jewelry"
3. **Test multilingual support** by changing the language
4. **Verify Bengali translations** work correctly
5. **Check product recommendations** for accuracy

This fix resolves the DNS resolution issue that was preventing the frontend container from starting properly.
