2. **deploy-gke.bat** - Deployment script for Windows
3. **k8s/backend-deployment.yaml** - Backend deployment configuration
4. **k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml** - Frontend deployment configuration

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Verify all prerequisites (tools installed and authenticated)
2. Update configuration files with your project ID
3. Create service account and Kubernetes secret

### Phase 2: Infrastructure
1. Create GKE cluster
2. Configure kubectl to connect to the cluster

### Phase 3: Application Deployment
1. Build Docker images for frontend and backend
2. Push images to Google Container Registry
3. Deploy to Kubernetes using kustomize
4. Verify deployment status

### Phase 4: Access and Testing
1. Get external IP for the frontend service
2. Access application and test functionality
3. Verify all features work correctly

## Key Features Deployed

1. **AI Shopping Assistant** - With Gemini AI integration
2. **Multilingual Support** - With Google Cloud Translation API
3. **Text-to-Speech** - With Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
4. **Speech-to-Text** - With Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
5. **Online Boutique Integration** - With Google's demo shop

## Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- ✅ Application accessible via external IP
- ✅ Shopping assistant provides accurate recommendations
- ✅ Multilingual support works for all languages including Bengali
- ✅ Google Cloud TTS provides high-quality audio
- ✅ All containers running in Kubernetes pods
- ✅ Proper scaling configuration with HPA

## Next Steps

1. Run the prerequisite verification script
2. Update configuration files with your project ID
3. Create service account and secret
4. Execute the deployment steps
5. Test the deployed application
6. Prepare for hackathon submission

## Support Files

Additional documentation files available:
- GKE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - Detailed deployment instructions
- GKE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md - Complete checklist for deployment
- QUICK_START_GKE.md - Quick start guide
- GKE_FILES_SUMMARY.md - Summary of all GKE-related files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the deployment logs
2. Verify all prerequisites are met
3. Ensure service account has correct permissions
4. Confirm images were pushed to GCR successfully
5. Review Kubernetes pod logs for errors

## Security Notes

1. Service account keys are stored as Kubernetes secrets
2. No hardcoded credentials in source code
3. Proper IAM roles assigned to service account
4. Network policies can be added for additional security

## Performance Considerations

1. Autoscaling enabled for both frontend and backend
2. Resource requests and limits configured
3. Health checks implemented
4. HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) configured
