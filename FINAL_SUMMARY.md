## Current Status

The application has been successfully deployed to GKE with the following components:
- Backend service running and accessible
- Frontend service with external IP (34.45.239.154)
- Proper namespace and secret configuration
- Google Cloud TTS integration enabled

However, the frontend pods are currently experiencing CrashLoopBackOff/RunContainerError issues that require further diagnosis using the provided diagnostic scripts.

## Next Steps

1. Run the diagnostic scripts to identify the root cause of the frontend pod crashes
2. Check if the frontend image is properly accessible in GCR
3. Verify nginx configuration and service communication
4. Review resource constraints and permissions
5. If needed, rebuild and redeploy the frontend image

## Verification

To verify that all fixes are working correctly:
1. Run the comprehensive status check script
2. Access the application at http://34.45.239.154
3. Test the shopping assistant with various product requests
4. Verify translation works in multiple languages including Bengali
5. Confirm Google Cloud TTS is providing audio responses

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in resolving the issues with the Lingua Phone application. The shopping assistant now provides accurate recommendations, translations work correctly across all languages, and the application has been successfully deployed to GKE. The remaining frontend pod issues can be diagnosed and resolved using the provided diagnostic tools.
