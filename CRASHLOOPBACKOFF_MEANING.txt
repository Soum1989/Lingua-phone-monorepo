WHAT DOES "CrashLoopBackOff" MEAN?

================================

This is a Kubernetes pod status that indicates your frontend application
is stuck in a crash-restart loop. Here's what's happening:

1. Kubernetes starts your frontend pod
2. Something goes wrong and the application crashes
3. Kubernetes waits a moment and tries to restart it
4. The application crashes again
5. Kubernetes waits longer and tries again
6. This cycle continues indefinitely

WHY THIS HAPPENS:

Common causes include:
- Configuration errors
- Missing dependencies
- Port conflicts
- Permission issues
- Application bugs

WHAT WE'VE DONE TO FIX IT:

We've identified and addressed the root cause:
✓ Updated frontend deployment configuration
✓ Fixed nginx configuration to properly reference backend service
✓ Applied updated configuration to your GKE cluster
✓ Deleted old pod to force creation of a new one with our fixes

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NOW:

1. Wait a few minutes for the new pod to initialize with our fixes
2. Run: COMPLETE_STATUS_CHECK.bat to check if the pod is now running
3. Look for the frontend pod to show "1/1 Running" status
4. Access your application at: http://34.45.239.154

IF IT'S STILL CRASHING:

1. Run: diagnose-frontend-crash.bat for detailed diagnostics
2. Check the generated log files for specific error messages
3. Review the nginx configuration in docker/nginx-k8s.conf
4. Verify the backend service name matches in all configurations

This is a common issue during Kubernetes deployments and our fixes
should resolve it. Please allow a few minutes for the changes to take effect.
