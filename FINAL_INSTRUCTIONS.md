## Recent Fix for Frontend CrashLoopBackOff

We've identified and addressed the cause of the frontend pod crashing:

### What Was Fixed
1. **Frontend Deployment Configuration**: Updated to properly use ConfigMap for nginx configuration
2. **Nginx Configuration**: Ensured correct backend service reference
3. **ConfigMap Mounting**: Fixed how the nginx configuration is mounted in the pod

### Files Modified
- [k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml) - Updated volume mounts
- [k8s/configmap.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/k8s/configmap.yaml) - Verified nginx configuration
- [docker/nginx-k8s.conf](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/nginx-k8s.conf) - Verified backend service name

## How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Current Status
Run this command to see if the frontend pod is now running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n lingua-app
```

Look for output similar to:
```
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
lingua-backend-866f7c48b4-rxz9m    1/1     Running   0          2h
lingua-frontend-578867dfc7-abc12   1/1     Running   0          5m
```

### 2. Run Our Verification Scripts
We've created several scripts to help you check the status:

1. **Complete Status Check**:
   ```
   COMPLETE_STATUS_CHECK.bat
   ```

2. **Python Verification Script**:
   ```
   python VERIFY_FRONTEND_FIX.py
   ```

### 3. Access Your Application
Once the frontend pod is running, your application should be accessible at:
http://34.45.239.154

## If the Frontend is Still Crashing

If the frontend pod continues to show CrashLoopBackOff:

### 1. Run Detailed Diagnostics
```
diagnose-frontend-crash.bat
```

This will create detailed log files:
- `frontend-logs.txt` - Previous pod logs
- `frontend-logs-current.txt` - Current pod logs
- `frontend-describe.txt` - Detailed pod information

### 2. Check Common Issues
1. **Backend Service Name**: Ensure it's `lingua-backend-service` in all configurations
2. **Nginx Configuration**: Check [docker/nginx-k8s.conf](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/nginx-k8s.conf) syntax
3. **ConfigMap Mounting**: Verify the volume mount in [k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml)

### 3. Manual Verification Commands
```bash
# Check pod details
kubectl describe pod -l app=lingua-frontend -n lingua-app

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -l app=lingua-frontend -n lingua-app

# Check previous pod logs (if crashing)
kubectl logs -l app=lingua-frontend -n lingua-app --previous

# Check services
kubectl get services -n lingua-app
```

## Testing Application Functionality

Once the frontend is running, test these features:

### 1. Shopping Assistant
- Request products in English and Bengali
- Ask for gender-specific items (women's vs men's clothing)
- Request items not in inventory to see smart recommendations

### 2. Translation
- Change language in the UI
- Verify responses are in the selected language
- Test all supported languages

### 3. Google Cloud TTS
- Enable audio responses
- Verify proper audio quality
- Test fallback when TTS is unavailable
