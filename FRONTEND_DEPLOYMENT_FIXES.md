# Frontend Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Dockerfile Path**: The [frontend.Dockerfile](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile) that was moved to the root had incorrect COPY paths that caused the build to fail with "no source files were specified".

2. **Empty cloudbuild.yaml**: The cloudbuild.yaml file was empty, preventing automated builds.

3. **Redundant Directory**: The shopping-cart directory contained a separate application that was not integrated with the main monorepo, causing confusion.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Removed Incorrect Dockerfile**: Deleted the incorrectly configured [frontend.Dockerfile](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile) from the root.

2. **Created Proper cloudbuild.yaml**: Added a complete cloudbuild.yaml configuration for automated frontend builds and deployments.

3. **Verified Correct Dockerfile**: Confirmed that [docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile) has the correct paths for building from the root context.

## Current Deployment Process

To deploy the frontend:

1. **Manual Build**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/lingua-frontend:latest -f docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile .
   docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/lingua-frontend:latest
   ```

2. **Automated Build** (using Cloud Build):
   The cloudbuild.yaml file will automatically:
   - Build the frontend image using [docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile)
   - Push the image to Google Container Registry
   - Tag the image with both commit SHA and latest tags

3. **Deploy to GKE**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
   ```

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Unused Files**: Consider removing unused batch files and documentation files to simplify the repository.

2. **Update Documentation**: Update deployment documentation to reflect the current process using [docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile).

3. **Verify Image Names**: Ensure that the image names in [k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml) match the images built by cloudbuild.yaml.

4. **Test Deployment**: Test the deployment process to ensure everything works correctly.
