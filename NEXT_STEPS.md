# Next Steps for Lingua Phone Application

## Immediate Actions

1. **Check Current Status**
   Run the following command to check if our fixes have resolved the frontend crash issue:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app
   ```

2. **If Frontend is Still Crashing**
   Run the diagnostic script to get detailed information:
   ```
   diagnose-frontend-crash.bat
   ```

3. **View Detailed Summary**
   Open these files to understand what was fixed and what to do next:
   - `STATUS_SUMMARY.md` - Current status and next steps
   - `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete list of fixes and improvements

## Verifying the Fix

1. **Check Pod Status**
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app
   ```
   Look for the frontend pod to show `1/1 Running` status

2. **Check Service Status**
   ```
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app
   ```
   Verify both frontend and backend services are properly configured

3. **Access Your Application**
   Visit: http://34.45.239.154

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Logs**
   ```
   kubectl logs -l app=lingua-frontend -n lingua-app
   ```

2. **Check Detailed Pod Information**
   ```
   kubectl describe pod -l app=lingua-frontend -n lingua-app
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration Files**
   - Check [docker/nginx-k8s.conf](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/nginx-k8s.conf) for correct backend service name
   - Verify [k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml) properly mounts the ConfigMap

## Testing Application Functionality

Once the frontend is running:

1. **Test Shopping Assistant**
   - Try requesting products in different languages
   - Verify gender-specific recommendations work correctly
   - Check that missing products show appropriate messages

2. **Test Translation**
   - Ensure responses are in the user's selected language
   - Verify all languages including Bengali work properly

3. **Test Google Cloud TTS**
   - Confirm audio responses are working
   - Verify fallback mechanism works if TTS is unavailable

## Additional Resources

- All deployment scripts are in the root directory
- Configuration files are in the [docker/](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/docker/) and [k8s/](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/k8s/) directories
- Application source code is in the [packages/](file:///c%3A/Users/Lenovo/Lingua-phone-monorepo/packages/) directory
