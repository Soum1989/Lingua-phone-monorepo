# Lingua Phone Deployment Progress

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Frontend Container DNS Resolution Error**
   - Error: "nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream lingua-backend-service:3002"
   - Fix: Changed nginx.conf upstream server from "lingua-backend-service:3002" to "backend:3002" to match docker-compose service name

2. **Missing TypeScript Configuration**
   - Error: Frontend container failing to build due to missing tsconfig.json
   - Fix: Created packages/frontend/tsconfig.json and packages/frontend/tsconfig.node.json

3. **Google Cloud TTS Not Enabled**
   - Error: "Google Cloud TTS not available, using fallback"
   - Fix: Saved service account key, updated docker-compose.yml to mount keys, and provided instructions for granting proper IAM permissions

4. **Component Definition Issues**
   - Error: JavaScript syntax errors in App.tsx
   - Fix: Restructured component definitions to ensure proper scope

5. **Namespace Not Found Error**
   - Error: "failed to create secret namespaces "lingua-app" not found"
   - Fix: Created namespace before creating secret

6. **Frontend Pod Crashing (CrashLoopBackOff)**
   - Error: Frontend pod continuously restarting with CrashLoopBackOff status
   - Fix: Created separate Kubernetes-specific Dockerfile, updated ConfigMap to include nginx configuration, and simplified frontend deployment

7. **RunContainerError**
   - Error: Frontend pod showing RunContainerError status
   - Fix: Rebuilt and pushed frontend Docker image, deleted pods to force recreation

## Current Status

The frontend pods are still experiencing issues with RunContainerError, which indicates there's a problem with starting the container itself. This could be due to:

1. Issues with the Docker image
2. Problems with the container runtime environment
3. Configuration issues in the Kubernetes deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Docker Image**
   - Ensure the frontend image is properly built and pushed to Google Container Registry
   - Check that the image contains all necessary files and configurations

2. **Check Kubernetes Deployment Configuration**
   - Verify that the deployment YAML file is correctly configured
   - Ensure all required environment variables and configurations are set

3. **Review Container Logs**
   - Once we can access the logs, check for specific error messages that indicate what's causing the container to fail

4. **Test Locally**
   - Try running the frontend container locally to ensure it works outside of Kubernetes

## Files Modified

- `docker/frontend-k8s.Dockerfile` - Kubernetes-specific frontend Dockerfile
- `docker/nginx-k8s.conf` - Kubernetes-specific nginx configuration
- `k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml` - Frontend deployment configuration
- Various batch scripts to work around PowerShell terminal issues

## Scripts Created

- `get-pod-details.bat` - To get detailed information about frontend pods
- `check-deployment.bat` - To check deployment configurations
- `check-images.bat` - To verify images in Google Container Registry
- `rebuild-and-push-frontend.bat` - To rebuild and push the frontend image
- `check-status-after-rebuild.bat` - To check status after rebuild
- `simple-check.bat` - Simple status check script

## Verification Steps

1. Check if the frontend image exists in Google Container Registry
2. Verify the frontend deployment configuration
3. Check pod status and logs when possible
4. Test accessing the application through the LoadBalancer service
