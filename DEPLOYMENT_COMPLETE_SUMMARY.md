## Deployment Instructions

To complete the deployment of your Lingua Phone application:

1. **Run the Final Deployment Script**:
   Double-click on `final-deployment-fix.bat` to execute the complete deployment process

2. **Verify Successful Deployment**:
   Check that both frontend and backend pods show "1/1 Running" status

3. **Access Your Application**:
   - Note the EXTERNAL-IP from the service status
   - Open a web browser and navigate to http://<EXTERNAL-IP>

## Expected Outcomes

After successful deployment:
- The frontend pod will no longer crash with CrashLoopBackOff
- The application will be accessible through the external IP
- All shopping assistant functionalities will work correctly
- Multilingual support will function properly
- Google Cloud TTS will be enabled
- Product recommendations will be accurate and gender-appropriate

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check pod logs:
   ```
   kubectl logs <frontend-pod-name> -n lingua-app --previous
   ```

2. Check pod description:
   ```
   kubectl describe pod <frontend-pod-name> -n lingua-app
   ```

3. Verify services:
   ```
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app
   ```

4. Ensure the backend service is accessible:
   ```
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app
   ```

## Testing the Application

Once deployed, test the following functionalities:

1. Shopping assistant recommendations in English and Bengali
2. Gender-specific clothing recommendations
3. Translation functionality
4. Google Cloud TTS
5. Product rendering from Bazaar Marketplace
