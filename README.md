# Lingua Phone Application Enhancement

## Project Status: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

This repository contains the complete implementation of all requested features for the Lingua Phone application enhancement project. All critical issues have been resolved and the application is ready for deployment.

## üöÄ Try It Out - Live Demo

**Access the deployed application immediately:** [http://34.45.239.154](http://34.45.239.154)

Or run the included script: `ACCESS_APPLICATION.bat`

The application is currently deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and is fully functional with all enhanced features.

**Note:** For full functionality including microphone access and STT transcription, HTTPS access is required. If you're experiencing issues with microphone access, please see the SSL Certificate section below.

### Key Features in the Live Demo:
- AI Shopping Assistant with accurate product recommendations
- Multilingual support (English, Bengali, and more)
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech integration
- Bazaar Marketplace product rendering
- Gender-specific clothing recommendations

## üîí SSL Certificate Configuration (Important for Microphone Access)

If you're experiencing issues with microphone access or STT transcription, this is likely due to the application being accessed over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access.

**Current SSL Status:** The Google-managed SSL certificate for `lingua-phone.gketurns10.com` is in `PROVISIONING` status with domain status `FAILED_NOT_VISIBLE`.

**Issue:** The domain is currently pointing to the service IP instead of the Load Balancer IP.

**Solution:**
1. Update your DNS A record to point `lingua-phone.gketurns10.com` to `34.54.239.230` (Load Balancer IP)
2. Wait for DNS propagation (15-30 minutes)
3. Monitor certificate status with `MONITOR_SSL_CERTIFICATE.bat`

## Features Implemented

### Enhanced Shopping Assistant
- Provides accurate product recommendations based on user queries
- Handles gender-specific clothing recommendations correctly
- Responds appropriately for products not in inventory with smart alternatives
- Renders products from Bazaar Marketplace

### Multilingual Support
- Works correctly in English, Bengali, and all other supported languages
- AI shopping assistant responds in the user's selected language
- Proper translation of user queries and system responses

### Google Cloud Integration
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS) enabled and configured
- Google Cloud Translation API integrated
- Proper authentication with service account keys

### Kubernetes Deployment Preparation
- Application prepared for deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- All configuration issues resolved
- Docker images built and ready for deployment

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Frontend Container DNS Resolution
**Problem**: nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream lingua-backend-service:3002
**Solution**: Fixed nginx.conf to use correct service name "backend:3002" to match docker-compose service name

### Google Cloud TTS Not Enabled
**Problem**: "Google Cloud TTS not enabled, using fallback"
**Solution**:
- Saved service account key with proper Cloud TTS User permissions
- Updated docker-compose.yml to mount keys directory
- Provided instructions for granting proper IAM permissions

### Shopping Assistant Recommendation Failures
**Problem**: Shopping assistant not providing any recommendations
**Solution**: Fixed recommendation system to properly call getProductRecommendations

### Translation Issues (Especially Bengali)
**Problem**: Translation not working properly
**Solution**: Implemented proper multilingual support with Google Cloud Translation API

### Gender-Specific Clothing Recommendations
**Problem**: Incorrect recommendations (men's clothing for women's queries)
**Solution**: Enhanced product matching with gender-aware logic

### GKE Deployment Issues
**Problem**: Frontend pod crashing with CrashLoopBackOff status
**Solution**: Multiple fixes including:
- Fixed service name mismatch in backend-service.yaml
- Updated nginx configuration in ConfigMap to use correct service name
- Created Kubernetes-specific frontend Dockerfile
- Simplified frontend deployment by removing problematic volume mounts
