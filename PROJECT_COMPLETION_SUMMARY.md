## üîí SSL Certificate Deployment - Afternoon Plan

A robust SSL certificate deployment is planned for this afternoon (3:00 PM onwards) to enable:
- HTTPS access to the application
- Microphone permissions for STT transcription
- Full browser security compliance

### Resources Prepared:
- [AFTERNOON_SSL_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](AFTERNOON_SSL_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md) - Complete deployment strategy
- [AFTERNOON_SSL_CHECKLIST.md](AFTERNOON_SSL_CHECKLIST.md) - Step-by-step readiness checklist
- [CLEANUP_SSL_RESOURCES.bat](CLEANUP_SSL_RESOURCES.bat) - Script to prepare for fresh deployment
- [MONITOR_SSL_CERTIFICATE.bat](MONITOR_SSL_CERTIFICATE.bat) - Continuous monitoring tool

### Key Steps for Afternoon Session:
1. Clean up existing SSL resources
2. Verify DNS configuration (A record pointing to Load Balancer IP: 34.54.239.230)
3. Deploy new managed certificate and ingress
4. Monitor provisioning status
5. Test HTTPS access and microphone functionality

## Features Successfully Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Shopping Assistant

- ‚úÖ Proper authentication with service account keys

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment Preparation
- ‚úÖ Application prepared for deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- ‚úÖ All configuration issues resolved
- ‚úÖ Docker images built and ready for deployment

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Frontend Container DNS Resolution
**Problem**: nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream lingua-backend-service:3002
**Solution**: Fixed nginx.conf to use correct service name "backend:3002" to match docker-compose service name

### Google Cloud TTS Not Enabled
**Problem**: "Google Cloud TTS not enabled, using fallback"
**Solution**:
- Saved service account key with proper Cloud TTS User permissions
- Updated docker-compose.yml to mount keys directory
- Provided instructions for granting proper IAM permissions

### Shopping Assistant Recommendation Failures
**Problem**: Shopping assistant not providing any recommendations
**Solution**: Fixed recommendation system to properly call getProductRecommendations

### Translation Issues (Especially Bengali)
**Problem**: Translation not working properly
**Solution**: Implemented proper multilingual support with Google Cloud Translation API

### Gender-Specific Clothing Recommendations
**Problem**: Incorrect recommendations (men's clothing for women's queries)
**Solution**: Enhanced product matching with gender-aware logic

### GKE Deployment Issues
**Problem**: Frontend pod crashing with CrashLoopBackOff status
**Solution**: Multiple fixes including:
- Fixed service name mismatch in backend-service.yaml
- Updated nginx configuration in ConfigMap to use correct service name
- Created Kubernetes-specific frontend Dockerfile
- Simplified frontend deployment by removing problematic volume mounts
