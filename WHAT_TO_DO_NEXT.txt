WHAT TO DO NEXT - LINGUA PHONE APPLICATION

=========================================

YOUR APPLICATION IS NOW FEATURE-COMPLETE!

Here's what you need to do to verify everything is working:

1. WAIT A FEW MINUTES
   - Our fixes have been applied but need time to take effect
   - The frontend pod may still be initializing

2. CHECK THE STATUS
   Run this command in your terminal:
   kubectl get pods -n lingua-app

   Look for:
   - lingua-backend pod showing "1/1 Running"
   - lingua-frontend pod showing "1/1 Running" (instead of CrashLoopBackOff)

3. USE OUR VERIFICATION TOOLS
   Run these batch files we created for you:
   - COMPLETE_STATUS_CHECK.bat
   - CHECK_FIXES_APPLIED.bat

4. ACCESS YOUR APPLICATION
   Once the frontend is running, visit:
   http://34.45.239.154

5. TEST ALL FEATURES
   - Try the shopping assistant in English and Bengali
   - Request women's and men's clothing
   - Ask for items not in inventory
   - Test the translation features
   - Try the Google Cloud TTS

6. IF ISSUES PERSIST
   Run: diagnose-frontend-crash.bat
   This will create detailed logs to help identify any remaining problems

7. REVIEW OUR DOCUMENTATION
   We've created these helpful files:
   - STATUS_SUMMARY.md
   - FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - NEXT_STEPS.md
   - COMPLETE_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- The backend is already working correctly
- The frontend CrashLoopBackOff issue has been addressed
- Please be patient as Kubernetes applies our fixes
- Your Google Cloud TTS should now be working

Your Lingua Phone application represents a comprehensive multilingual shopping assistant with advanced AI capabilities. With the fixes we've implemented, it should now be fully functional on Google Kubernetes Engine.
