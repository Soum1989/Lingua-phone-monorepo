# Frontend Container Issues and Solutions

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing TypeScript Configuration**: The frontend was missing `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` files required for TypeScript compilation.

2. **Component Definition Issue**: The `AutoTranslate` component in `App.tsx` was being used but not properly defined in the right scope.

3. **Docker Container Not Starting**: Only the backend container was running, but the frontend container was not starting.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added TypeScript Configuration Files

Created `packages/frontend/tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
}
```

Created `packages/frontend/tsconfig.node.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  },
  "include": ["vite.config.ts"]
}
```

### 2. Fixed Component Definition

Moved the `AutoTranslate` component definition outside of the main App component render function to ensure proper scope and avoid reference issues.

### 3. Docker Configuration

The frontend Dockerfile appears to be correctly configured:
- Uses a multi-stage build process
- Builds the frontend using Vite
- Uses Nginx for serving the static files
- Exposes port 80

The docker-compose.yml also appears correct:
- Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container
- Sets up proper dependencies between frontend and backend

## Next Steps

1. Try to restart the Docker environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

2. Check the Docker logs if containers still don't start:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs frontend
   docker-compose logs backend
   ```

3. Verify that both containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:8080

## Troubleshooting

If the frontend container still doesn't start:

1. Try building the frontend locally first to check for compilation errors:
   ```bash
   cd packages/frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Check if there are any syntax errors in the frontend code:
   ```bash
   cd packages/frontend
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
