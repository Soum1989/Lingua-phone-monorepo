HOW TO DEPLOY LINGUA PHONE TO GKE
=================================

Due to terminal issues, please follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. Close this PowerShell terminal window completely.

2. Open a NEW Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell window:
   - Press Windows key
   - Type "cmd" or "PowerShell"
   - Press Enter

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd C:\Users\Lenovo\Lingua-phone-monorepo

4. Execute the deployment script:
   complete-deployment-steps.bat

This script will automatically perform all the necessary steps:
- Create the namespace "lingua-app"
- Create the secret for Google Cloud credentials
- Build the Docker images for backend and frontend
- Deploy the application to GKE
- Verify the deployment

If any step fails, the script will show an error message and stop execution.

After successful deployment:
1. Check the services to get the external IP:
   kubectl get services -n lingua-app

2. Look for the frontend service and note its external IP.

3. Access the application in your browser using:
   http://<EXTERNAL-IP>

Troubleshooting:
- If the namespace already exists, you can skip that step
- If the secret already exists, you can delete it first with:
  kubectl delete secret google-cloud-key --namespace=lingua-app
- If you encounter permission issues, ensure your Google Cloud service account has the necessary permissions
