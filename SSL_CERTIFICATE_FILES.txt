IMPORTANT NOTES:

- The SSL certificate issue is caused by the domain pointing to the service IP (34.45.239.154) 
  instead of the Load Balancer IP (34.54.239.230)
  
- To fix this issue, you need to update your DNS A record to point lingua-phone.gketurns10.com 
  to 34.54.239.230
  
- After updating DNS, wait for propagation (15-30 minutes) and monitor the certificate status
  
- Once the certificate becomes active, the application will be fully accessible via HTTPS 
  with all features including microphone access for STT transcription
