echo Diagnostic Tools Creation Complete
echo ========================================
echo.

echo I've created several diagnostic scripts to help troubleshoot the frontend pod issues in your GKE deployment:
echo.

echo 1. application-status.bat - Basic status check
echo 2. check-frontend-deployment.bat - Detailed frontend deployment check
echo 3. check-backend-service.bat - Detailed backend service check
echo 4. comprehensive-status-check.bat - Complete diagnostic of all components
echo 5. fix-frontend-deployment.bat - Attempt to fix frontend deployment by recreating pods
echo.

echo README.txt contains instructions on how to use these scripts.
echo.

echo Due to the persistent issues with the PowerShell terminal, these batch scripts should be run directly by double-clicking them or executing them from the command prompt.
echo.

echo The most likely issues causing the frontend pod crashes are:
echo 1. Image pull issues (the frontend image may not be accessible in GCR)
echo 2. Configuration issues with the nginx setup
echo 3. Resource constraints
echo 4. Permission issues
echo.

echo Next Steps:
echo 1. Run comprehensive-status-check.bat to get a full picture of the current state
echo 2. Run fix-frontend-deployment.bat to attempt to recreate the frontend pods
echo 3. Check the logs and events to identify the root cause of the RunContainerError
echo 4. If the issue persists, we may need to rebuild and push the frontend image to GCR
echo.

echo Please run these diagnostic scripts and let me know the results so we can continue troubleshooting.
echo.
